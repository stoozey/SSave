## Incredibly majestic words of advice

### Demo

The important bits to look at for this demo are in:
- `obj_ssave_demo_manager` - handles saving/loading logic
- `scr_ssave_demo_saves` - defines the save and config files

Any other code/assets aren't relevant to SSave itself.

### SSave

Everything you need is right in the root SSave folder, so there's no need to go into the `Internal` folder - unless you want to...?
